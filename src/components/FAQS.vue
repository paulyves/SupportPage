      <p>The analog phone attached to your base unit is extension 10. To call that, dial 10. If you have a wifi phone unit, its extension number is 11. To call that, dial 11. If you dial your landline number using your SIM, It will be like calling yourself and your Wavephone Dialer app will ring.</p>

      <p>Three ways. First, the QR card you used to activate or login to the Wavephone Dialer app has your Wavephone number written on it. The 7-digit number above the QR code is your Wavephone number. Second, if you lost your QR card, go to Settings > Account Setup in the app. The 7-digit number preceding the last 2-digits of the username is your Wavephone number. And third is by calling another extension. If you see a 9-digit number on the app of the person you are calling, the first 7 digits is your Wavephone number.</p>

      <p>People who share the same base unit share the same Wavephone number. People who share the same Wavephone number can call each other simply by dialling their assigned 2-digit extension numbers. People who have different Wavephone numbers can call each other by dialling their assigned 7-digit number plus 2-digit extension number forming a 9-digit number. For example, if my Wavephone number is 8008080 and my extension number is 18, then people can call me through their Wavephone Dialer app by dialling 800808018.</p>
